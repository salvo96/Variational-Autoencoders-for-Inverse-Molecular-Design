# Variational Autoencoders for Inverse Molecular Design

Code developed as a research work in the field of Bioinformatics applied to the study of molecular structures using Generative Models. 

The work was developed as a Master Thesis topic and it is the result of a research carried out at [SOCO](https://soco.upc.edu/en) and [IDEAI](https://ideai.upc.edu/en) groups at [Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (Barcelona, SPAIN)](https://www.upc.edu/en).

## Abstract
The study of new compounds is a process of relevant importance
for the discovery of novel materials and over the years has
allowed the spread of various new substances that in many cases
have radically changed the quality of our lives. This process,
approached in a traditional way is very long and expensive, for
that reason new methods are emerging, one of them is Inverse
molecular design. The idea represents a change of paradigm,
where new compounds are designed defining first the properties.
Such solution leads to a variety of different compounds represented
into a chemical space which must be explored to find
the most suitable molecule. Classical attempts using equation
computation or simulation are often not feasible, unless a tool
for optimization is used. This work studies a possible approach
to the problem exploiting the benefits of Deep Learning through
Generative Models. The use of a particular neural network architecture
like a Variational Autoencoder is examined investigating
the potentials and the limits of compounds generation in the
Inverse molecular design workflow.
